<h1> The Best Movies According to Fernando </h1>
    <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>
    <hr>

        <h3> Legion </h3>
            <p> This is one of my favorite movies due to message it sends across. Nothing is promised in this world
                and we are just here momentarily.
            </p>

        <h3> The day after tomorrow </h3>
            <p> One of my favorite movies that points out the issues we currently have with global warming. Over all-time
                weather conditions keep worsening.
            </p>
            
        <h3> The wolf of wall street </h3>
            <p> Many messages in this movie starting with having goals in life is important and to be ambitious of your goals
                as well. Also, lets us know not to take any shortcuts and/or do anything illegal to get up top because at
                one point eventually will come back to bite us and bring us back to where we started, if not worst.
